## Introduction

**SAS** is an integrated system of software solutions that enables the user to perform the following tasks:

-  data entry, retrieval, and management
-  report writing and graphics design
-  statistical and mathematical analysis
-  business forecasting and decision support
-  operations research and project management
-  applications development

It was developed in the early 1970s at North Carolina University and was originally intended for management and analysis of agricultural field experiments. Now is the most widely used statistical software.

Some of the most important products of the SAS system are:

Name | Description
--- | ---
**Base SAS** | Data management and basic procedures
**SAS/STAT** | Statistical analysis
**SAS/GRAPH** | Presentation quality graphics
**SAS/OR** | Operations research
**SAS/ETS** | Econometrics and time series analysis
**SAS/IML** | Interactive matrix language
**SAS/AF** | Applications facility (menus and interfaces)
**SAS/QC** | Quality control

There are other specialized products for spreadsheets, access to DBs, connectivity between different machines running SAS, etc.

## Basic structure of SAS

There are two main components to most SAS programs:
- **data step**: reads data from external sources, manipulates and combines it with other data set and prints reports. This step is used to prepare the data for use by one of the procedures
- **procedure step**: perform analysis on the data, and produce output

SAS organizes data into tables called **SAS data set**, the following figure shows one of them:

</p>

1. each column of the table is called **VARIABLE**
2. each row of the table is called **OBSERVATION** and represents information about an individual entity
3. each separate peace of information is a **DATA VALUE**

In SAS data set, an observation contains all the data values for an entity and a variable contains the same type of data value for all entities.

Using the previous table as example, we can see how to build that table:

```sass
data people;
input id gender name;
datalines;
;
run;
```

1. The `data` statement tells SAS to begin building a SAS data set named *people*
2. The `input` statement identifies the fields to be read from the input data and names the SAS variables to be created from them (*id, gender, name, age*)
3. The `datalines` statement indicates the data lines follow
4. The data lines follow the `datalines` statement
5. The semicolon signals the end of the raw data, and this is a step boundary; it tells SAS that the preceding statements are ready for execution

Data steps begin with the word `data` and procedure steps begin with the word `proc`.

#### SAS language conventions

The most important rules when writing SAS statements are:

- SAS statement end with a **semicolon**
- you can enter SAS statements in lowercase, uppercase or a mixture of two because SAS is not case sensitive
- you can begin SAS statements in any column of a line and write several statements on the same line
- words in SAS statements are separated by **blanks** or special characters
- lines beginning with an asterisk (*) are treated as comments

**SAS NAMES** are used for SAS data set names, variable names and other items. The following rules apply:

- a SAS name can contain from 1 to 32 characters
- the first character must be a letter or an underscore
- subsequent characters must be letters, numbers or underscores
- blanks are not allowed in SAS names

## The Data step

The data step provides a wide range of capabilities, among them reading data from external sources, reshaping and manipulating data, transforming data and producing printed reports.

The data step is actually an implied do loop whose statements will be executed for each observation read from an external source. For each iteration, the data step starts a **vector of missing values** for all the variables to be placed in the new observation. It then overwrites the missing value for any variables either input or defined by the data step statements. Finally, it outputs the observation to the newly created data set.

Each data step begins with the word `data` and optionally one or more data set names followed by a `;`.

#### The input statement

The `input` statement of SAS is used to read data from an external source. The `infile` statement names an external file from which to read the data and the `datalines` statement is used to precede the data.

There are three basic forms of the input statement:

- **List input** (free form): data fields must be separated by at least one blank. List the names of the variables, follow the name with a dollar sign ($) for character data
- **Column input**: follow the variable name with `startingcolumn - endingcolumn`
- **Formatted input**: optionally precede the variable name with a `@startingcolumn`; follow the variable name with a SAS format designation

#### Modifiers of the input statement

The `:` modifier for list input tells SAS to use a format for input, but to stop when the next whitespace is found.
