## DWH

In computing a **Data Warehouse** (DWH) is a system used for **reporting** and **data analysis**, and is considered as a **core component** of **business intelligence** (BI).

#### What is a data warehouse?

There are many definitions of DWH, some of them are:

- a database designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing
- a database built for the purpose of analysis
- a database designed to help users understanding and enhancing their organization's performances
- a database designed to enable BI activities

The DWH has now been more generally seen as a **strategy** to bring **heterogenous data** together under a common conceptual and technical umbrella, and to make data available for new operation or decision support applications.

The DWH acts as the underlying engine used by BI environments that serve reports, dashboards and other interfaces to end users. Typical activities are:

- **slice and dice**: break a body of information down into smaller parts or to examine it from different viewpoints so that you can understand it better
- **drill-down**: the process of dividing an information area up into finer and finer layers in a hierarchy, but with the purpose of narrowing in to one small area or item

A DWH is subject-oriented, integrated, non-volatile and time-variant.
