## Introduction

**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language** and is one of the most used language for RDBMS with ANSI standard. The power of SQL comes from its ability to deal with data stored in relational tables with a **declarative syntax**. It is a very high-level language that focuses on "*what to do*" instead of "*how to do*".

#### Physical layer

From the [__Logical Model__](https://github.com/MarioCatuogno/Mappr.it/blob/master/articles/sql/db_architectures.md#logical-data-model) to the physical layer there are some changes:

* _RELATIONS_ becomes __TABLES__
* _FIELDS_ becomes __COLUMN NAMES__
* _RECORDS_ becomes __TABLE ROWS__ or __TUPLES__
* _Implicit constraints_ are hidden in __datatype definition__
* _Explicit constraints_ are implemented with __SQL constructs__
* _Foreign keys_ add __integrity constraints__ between related tables

So database becomes a "*collection of tables*", with rows and columns (2-dimensional).

#### Basic construct

A **QUERY** is a request for information from database. The informations may be generated as raw results returned by SQL or as graphs or more complex results with data-mining tools.

When a DB performs a SQL query the results are displayed as a virtual table, not stored in the DB. The basic constructs to build a query are:

* __SELECT__ (*desired attribute*): declare WHAT you want [*mandatory*]
* __FROM__ (*one or more tables*): declare WHERE to search [*mandatory*]
* __WHERE__ (*conditions about rows*): declare HOW to filter results [*optional*]

Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The logic of conditions in SQL is a 3-valued logic (*TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN*), where a tuple is in a WHERE clause if **TRUE**.

**Strings** are always enclosed by `" "`, while **numbers** are not. The WHERE clause allows the user to operate on a **sub-set** of a table, using the **comparison operators**: `< > <= >= =`.

#### Filtering conditions

There are also **filtering conditions**:

- **BETWEEN**: used to test for a range
- **IN**: used to test group membership
- **NOT**: used for negation
- **LIKE**: allows wildcard, the basic structure is `<attribute> LIKE <pattern>`, where pattern is a quoted string with `%` (any string), `_` any character
- **AND/OR**: to combine conditions
- **IS NULL/IS NOT NULL**: retrieve NULL values or avoid NULL values

```sql
BETWEEN "01-Jan" AND "31-Jan"
condition IN ("field1", "field2")
NOT (year >= "01-Jan")
lastname LIKE %Catuog%
```

There are other operators that can be used to further filtering results:

- **ROWNUM**: retrieve the first rows in a selection
- **ORDER BY**: sort the results by one or more columns, it sort in ascending order by default, to sort in descending order you can use `DESC`
- **DISTINCT**: retrieve not duplicate values for fields
- **AS**: to rename the output field

```sql
WHERE ROWNUM <= n
ORDER BY lastname DESC
SELECT DISTINCT lastname
SELECT lastname AS name
```

####Â Join operators

**FOREIGN KEYS** are used to establish table relationship and surf through data, that allow to join multiple tables. An **INNER JOIN OPERATOR** combines rows from two or more columns of two or more tables based on the correspondence of values for **COMMON ATTRIBUTES** among them, creating a new **VIRTUAL TABLE**.

It is possible to apply operators to **TABLE COLUMNS** to calculate new fields to display, some of them are:

- **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**
- **TEXT OPERATORS**
- **UPPER/LOWER**: to convert values of field to UPPERCASE or LOWERCASE
- **SUBSTR**: to extract characters from a string
- **LENGTH**: returns the length of the value in a string
- **ROUND**: used to round a numeric field to the number of specified decimals
- **SYSDATE**: return the current system date and time

```sql
price * months AS revenue
firstname||' '||lastname||' '||city AS contact
SUBSTR(plot,1,200)
LENGTH(plot)
ROUND(price,2)
```

## Aggregate functions

**Aggregate functions** return a single value, calculated from values of a column, in a SELECT statement result. There are various aggregate functions:

- **AVG**: return the average value
- **MAX/MIN**: return the MAX or MIN value in a column
- **SUM**: return the sum of a numbered-value column
- **COUNT**: return the number of rows that matches a specific criteria

```sql
AVG(price)
MAX(price) - MIN(price)
SUM(price)
SELECT COUNT(*)
```

Aggregate functions are often used with GROUP BY statement, useful to calculate partial aggregations, for example:

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(postal_code) AS district
  FROM customers
  GROUP BY city, postal_code
```

After the GROUP BY statement, it is possible to add **HAVING** clause to express conditions on the group, for example:

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(postal_code) AS district
  FROM customers
  GROUP BY city, postal_code
  HAVING COUNT(postal_code) >= 5
```

## Analytic functions

**Analytic functions** compute an aggregate value based on a group of rows. They are commonly used in **data warehouse** environment, some of them are:

- **RANK**: order values by ranking
- **DENSE_RANK**: same of RANK but without skipping rank values

```sql
RANK(ORDER BY(rating DESC))
```

## Nested query

A **nested query** is a query within a query. These are used when you need to query the results of a query.

The main advantages of subqueries are:

- they allow queries that are structured so that it is possible to isolate each part of the statement
- they provide alternative ways to perform operations that would otherwise require complex joins
- they are more readable than complex joins

Nested queries are used with the following purposes:

- to define a TABLE to be operated by a containing query
- to define the set of rows to be inserted into the targeted TABLE of a `CREATE TABLE` statement
- to define one or more values to be assigned to existing rows in an `UPDATE` statement
- to provide values for conditions in a `WHERE`, `HAVING` or `START WITH` clause or `SELECT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement

## SQL as data definition language

**CREATE TABLE** is used to create a TABLE in the DB, in which each column must have a **DATATYPE**. There are different kind of datatype (also called **DOMAIN**), some of them are: TEXT, NUMERIC, DATE, TIME, etc.

Each domain has a LENGTH.

**Constraints** are used to specify rules for the data in a table. It there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted by the constraint. The following are some of the most important constraints:

- **NOT NULL**: a column cannot store NULL values
- **UNIQUE**: each row of a column must have a unique value
- **PRIMARY KEY**: a column has a unique identity which helps to find a particular record in a table, more easily and quickly (max 1 per table)
- **FOREIGN KEY**: ensure the referential integrity of the data in one table to match values in another table; a foreign key constraint must reference an existing primary key
- **CHECK**: ensure that the value in a column meets specific conditions
- **DEFAULT**: specifies a default value for a column

Constraints can be specified inside the `CREATE TABLE` statement or after the table is created, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name
  (column1_name DATATYPE(size) constraint_name, ...)
```

It is possible to drop a table with the `DROP` statement, for example:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name
```
