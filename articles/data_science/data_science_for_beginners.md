## Big Data and Data Science

I think that the best way to start this blog is to define what a data scientist is, and there’s no better definition then the one given by [__D.J. Patil__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpatil/it) and [__Thomas Davenport__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/it):

> “_It’s a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data_”

__Big Data__ have opened up a world of new possibilities to statisticians who have developed technologies and analytical tools to extract relevant information for analysis and evaluation. These date are collected in __dataset__ and usually they contain heterogeneous information from different sources that are often non-structured (e.g. images, GPS coordinates or posts and comments on social networks); this involves the use of non-conventional instruments to extrapolate and manage information. In the past, the collected data were analyzed using the __descriptive statistics__ which fall within the field of __business intelligence__ with limited data sets and simple models, but today the datasets are much more complex and require the use of __inferential statistics__ and __non-linear models__.

A full 90% of all the data in the world has been generated over the last two years, demonstrating how the __Internet of Things__ has given a strong boost to the production of unstructured data. Knowing how to extrapolate the data is a nearly 200 years old job, but it is only in recent times that those who work in this sector must face new problems, which therefore need a new job figure that encompasses among its skills many experiences in various fields. The data scientists work is __multidisciplinary__: combining computer skills and programming with knowledge of economics and sociology, with the help of statistical tools and software created specifically. The traditional statistics struggled to adapt to the amount of data and for that reason __Data Science__ has emerged, proposing models and algorithms suitable to investigate data in unusual quantity to the statisticians and generating disciplines such as __Data Mining__ or __Machine Learning__.

But who exactly is a data scientists and how it operates?

## Who is a Data Scientist?

We can describe his work through three different macro-skills (see [__here__](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarioCatuogno/Mappr.it/master/infographics/info_datascience_skillset.jpg)):

* __Hacking skills__: are necessary for working with massive amount of electronic data that must be acquired, cleaned and manipulated.
* __Math and Statistics knowledge__: allows a data scientist to choose appropriate methods and tools in order to extract insight from data.
* __Substantive expertise__: in a scientific field is crucial for generating motivating questions and hypotheses and interpreting results.

The data scientists with this capabilities becomes more and more demanded in the corporate world. Labor market analysts agree that in the coming years there will be a big gap between the low supply and high demand for data scientists. Companies (as well as governments) are aware that they can gain competitive advantages from the data that are stored every day on Internet. For this reason in recent years Universities activated academic paths for the formation of these figures, until now formed independently only with experience and practice.

> “_The data scientists is an evolution of the quantitative analysts from which differ in the combination of varied skills and for a more distinct corporate mentality_”

In a famous article of the Harvard Business Review, the data scientist job is considered the sexiest of the world. The charm of this figure comes from the fact that is a new discipline and in full transformation, suitable for anyone, from the mathematical-statistical astrophysicists to engineers, economists and political scientists. More than anything else, what is interesting in this work is to discover the world through the data, surfing in an ocean of numbers in search of the essential informations. Knowing how to use the tools of this profession allows people to show up in the labor market, ever so complex and problematic, with a great business card.
