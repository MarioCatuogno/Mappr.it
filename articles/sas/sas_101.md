## Introduction

__SAS__ stands for _Statistical Analysis System_. It can performs many tasks but there are some basic program rules which affect SAS statements. Some of them are:

* all SAS statements must end with a semicolon (__;__)
* any number of SAS statements can appear on a single line provided they are separated by the semicolon
* SAS statements are not case sensitive and they can be entered in lowercase, uppercase, or a mixture of the two
* a delimited comment begins with a forward slash-asterisk (__/*__) and ends with an asterisk-forward slash (__*/__), all text within the delimiters is ignored by SAS
* SAS statements typically begin with a SAS keyword

#### SAS Rules

For __names__ and __variables__ there are some specific rules:

* all names must contain between 1 and 32 characters
* the first character appearing in a name must be a letter or an underscore, subsequent characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores
* SAS names are not case sensitive and they can be entered in lowercase, uppercase, or a mixture of the two
* if the variable in the `INPUT` statement is followed by a dollar sign (__$__), SAS assumes this is a character variable, otherwise is considered as a numeric variable

## SAS Library

SAS files are stored in __SAS Library__ which is simply a collection of _data sets_ that are stored in a folder. SAS files are stored either temporarily or permanently.

#### Temporary SAS Library

When you don't specify a library name at all, then the file is stored in a temporary folder called __Work__. When you close out the SAS session in which you created the SAS file, the temporary library and all of its files are removed from your computer's memory.

``` sas
data work.example;
```

#### Permanent SAS Library

If you use a library name other than the default library name __Work__ when creating a SAS file, then the file is stored permanently until you delete it.

``` sas
data mylibrary.example
```

## SAS Steps

#### DATA Step

Any portion of a SAS program that begins with a `DATA` statement and ends with a `RUN` statement is called a __DATA Step__.

``` sas
data work.example;
run;
```

DATA Steps are used to manage data. In detail, these steps are used to read raw or external data into a SAS dataset, to modify data values and to subset or merge data sets.

#### PROC Step

Any portion of a SAS program that begins with a `PROC` statement and ends with a `RUN` statement is called a __PROC Step__ or __Procedures__.

``` sas
proc print work.example;
run;
```

PROC Steps are in-built programs that allow us to analyze the data contained in a SAS dataset. These steps are used to calculate descriptive statistics, to generate summary reports and to create summary graphs and charts.
