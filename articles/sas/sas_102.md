## Entering data into SAS

You can enter your lines of data directly in your SAS program by using a `DATALINES` statement.

``` sas
data work.dataset;
input gender $ name $ age;
datalines;
M Mark 28
F Lety 29
M John 22
;
proc print;
run;
```

You can use `CARDS` instead of `DATALINES`, both means the same. There is no difference between these two keywords.

## Reading delimited data

The default delimiter is __blank__. If you have a data file with other delimiters such as comma or tab you need to define the delimiter before defining the variables using `INFILE` and `DLM=` options.

``` sas
data work.dataset;
infile datalines dlm=",";
input gender $ name $ age;
datalines;
M Mark 28
F Lety 29
M John 22
;
proc print;
run;
```

* For tab delimeter, the syntax would be `infile 'file-description' dlm='09'x`
* For colon delimiter, the syntax would be infile `'file-description' dlm=':'`

## Importing data into SAS

#### Proc Import

`PROC IMPORT` is a SAS procedure to import external files into SAS. It automates importing process so you don't need to specify variable type and variable length to import an external file. It supports various formats such as excel file, csv, txt etc.

##### 1. Importing Excel files

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.xls"
out=work.dataset
dbms=xls
replace;
sheet="Sheet1";
getname=YES;
range="Sheet1$B2:D10";
run;
```
The main keywords used in the program above are:
* __OUT__: to specify name of a data set that SAS creates
* __DBMS__: to specify the type of data to import
* __REPLACE__: to overwrite an existing SAS dataset
* __SHEET__: to import a specific sheet from an excel workbook
* __GETNAMES__: to include variable names from the first row of data
* __RANGE__: to specify which range SAS would import (B2:D10 from Sheet1)

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.xlsx"
out=work.dataset (keep = gender name)
dbms=xlsx
replace;
sheet="Sheet1";
getname=YES;
run;
```

In the program above we are using a different `DBMS`, importing an Excel 2007+ file format. The `OUT` followed by `KEEP` statement is used to retain the desired variables (eg. gender and name). In the same way you can use `DROP` statement to remove the variables that you don't want to retain.

It is possible to delete all the rows that have only missing data on variables, for example `proc import datafile="C:\dataset.xls" out=work.dataset (where=(gender NE. and name NE.))` will delete, during the import process, all the rows which contains missing value in both __gender__ and __name__ variables.

##### 2. Importing Tab-delimited files

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.txt"
out=work.dataset
dbms=dlm
replace;
delimiter='09'x;
getname=YES;
run;
```

The program above is similar to the code of importing excel file. The only difference is `DBMS=DLM` and `DELIMITER='09'x`.

##### 3. Importing Comma-delimited files with TXT extension

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.txt"
out=work.dataset
dbms=dlm
replace;
delimiter=',';
getname=YES;
run;
```

To get comma separated file with a TXT extension into SAS, specify `DELIMITER=','`.

##### 4. Importing Comma-delimited files with CSV extension

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.csv"
out=work.dataset
dbms=csv
replace;
getname=YES;
run;
```

To get comma separated file into SAS, specify `DBMS=CSV`.

##### 5. Importing a Space-delimited file

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.txt"
out=work.dataset
dbms=dlm
replace;
delimiter='20'x;
getname=YES;
run;
```

To extract a space delimited file, specify `DELIMITER='20'x`.

##### 6. Importing a file containing multiple delimiter

``` sas
proc import
datafile="C:\dataset.txt"
out=work.dataset
dbms=dlm
replace;
delimiter=','20'x';
getname=YES;
run;
```

If two or more delimiters, such as comma and tabs, quote them following `DELIMITER=option`.

#### Infile method

In SAS, there is one more method called `INFILE` to import an external file. It's a manual method of importing an external file as you need to specify variables and its types and length.

##### 1. Reading a CSV file

``` sas
data work.dataset;
infile 'C:\dataset.csv' dsd
firstobs=2;
input gender $ name $ age;
run;
```

The main keywords used in the program above are:

* __INFILE__: to specify path where data file is saved
* __DSD__: to set the default delimiter from a blank to comma
* __FIRSTOBS=2__: to tell SAS that first row contains variable names and data values starts from second row

##### 2. Reading a Tab-delimited file

``` sas
data work.dataset;
infile `C:\dataset.txt` dsd
dlm='09'x truncover;
input gender :$1. name $30. age 2.;
run;
```

We can use `DLM='09'x` to tell SAS that we are going to import a tab delimited file. The `TRUNCOVER` statement tells SAS to assign the raw data value to the variable even if the value is shorter than expected by the `INPUT` statement.


##### 3. Handle an external file

``` sas
filename dataset 'C:\dataset.csv';
data work.dataset;
infile dataset dsd;
input gender $ name $ age;
run;
```

To handle an external file we can use a `FILENAME` statement.
