## Introduction

**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language** and is one of the most used language for RDBMS with ANSI standard. The power of SQL comes from its ability to deal with data stored in relational tables with a **declarative syntax**. It is a very high-level language that focuses on "*what to do*" instead of "*how to do*".

#### Physical layer

From the [__Logical Model__](https://github.com/MarioCatuogno/Mappr.it/blob/master/articles/sql/db_architectures.md#logical-data-model) to the physical layer there are some changes:

* _RELATIONS_ becomes __TABLES__
* _FIELDS_ becomes __COLUMN NAMES__
* _RECORDS_ becomes __TABLE ROWS__ or __TUPLES__
* _Implicit constraints_ are hidden in __datatype definition__
* _Explicit constraints_ are implemented with __SQL constructs__
* _Foreign keys_ add __integrity constraints__ between related tables

So database becomes a "*collection of tables*", with rows and columns (2-dimensional).

#### Basic construct

A **QUERY** is a request for information from database. The informations may be generated as raw results returned by SQL or as graphs or more complex results with data-mining tools.

When a DB performs a SQL query the results are displayed as a virtual table, not stored in the DB. The basic constructs to build a query are:

* __SELECT__ (*desired attribute*): declare WHAT you want [*mandatory*]
* __FROM__ (*one or more tables*): declare WHERE to search [*mandatory*]
* __WHERE__ (*conditions about rows*): declare HOW to filter results [*optional*]

Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The logic of conditions in SQL is a 3-valued logic (*TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN*), where a tuple is in a WHERE clause if **TRUE**.
